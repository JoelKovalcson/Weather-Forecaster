# Weather Forecaster

## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

You can view the live project [here](https://joelkovalcson.github.io/Weather-Forecaster/).

This project focused on creating a Weather application using 3rd party APIs.

The requirements for the project were as follows:
* Allow a user to search for a city's weather.
  * Maintain a history of search results for the user to click on to view again.
* Weather data to be displayed must include:
  - City Name
  - Date
  - Icon representing weather
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - UV Index
- A forecast of the next 5 days must also be displayed with all of the above information except city name and UV Index
* Information must be stored in `localStorage` to maintain user's search history

## What I Did

For this project, I began with HTML/CSS setup and planning before moving on to setting up the API requests and data storage. Along the way I included `Bootstrap` and `JQuery` to the project, along with `Moment.js`. Once I had finished setting up API requests and an outline of other functions, I began working on the search history display. Once that was working I focused on displaying the weather data dynamically to the screen. When I was finished with getting a single search displaying the weather and forecast, I moved on to making the search history functional. The project was finished by doing some refactoring and touch-ups of styling.
